        <h2>Managing University Life</h2>

        <p>University life is one that an individual can never truly be prepared for. No matter how much advice
            you receive, it is still a battle of finding the right balance with all the various aspects of your life.
            However, managing your university life, specifically, takes skill, which is time management.<br /><br />
            Time management is a skill that everyone has difficulty mastering, even me. It involves effectively using
            your time to complete outstanding tasks. It is like a scale, on one end we have proper time management
            and on the other end, we have procrastination. I have sadly fallen victim to procrastination many, many
            times. But I try to manage my time effectively. I do this by using my favourite productivity app, Notion,
            by creating to-do lists and by logging all my assignments. At university, there are so many things happening
            all at once. We have 10 assignments due from one course alone, weekly quizzes, labs, tutorials, projects, 
            presentations, group work and university life activities like parties and sporting activities. With all
            this workload, we somehow have to find time to study and prepare for mid-semesters and finals while still
            wanting to experience "university life". When thinking about it, it seems like a lot. That is why breaks
            are also very important. It is all about balance. Yes, you want to get 100% on that assignment worth 2% 
            but at what cost? Your mental health? (Not the best choice) It is best to choose the battles that you can
            win wisely. Because with the effort you are putting in to get 100% for that assignment worth 2%, you&apos;re
            forgetting about that project you have due in 4 days worth 35%. Yes, priorities. The key to managing
            university life is simply put balance.</p>

        <h2>The Art of Self-Care</h2>
        <p id="date-and-author2"><time datetime="2022-09-29">September 29, 2022</time> by Richelle Williams</p>
        <img id="self-care-picture" src="self-care.jpg" alt="woman doing yoga" width="350" height="260"/>
        <p>According to Google, self-care is the process of taking care of one's self with behaviours that promote health and
            active management of illness when it occurs. Self-care is important as it helps individuals be in their right
            minds to function effectively. Despite its importance, self-care is often neglected and placed at the bottom of
            one&apos;s priorities. But it should be at the top of everyone&apos;s priorities list.<br /><br /> Self-care
            does not look the same for everyone. The practice of self-care has to be tailored according to your likes and
            what best aligns with you. It can look like taking a walk, doing art, listening to music, meditating, journaling,
            reading, doing yoga or even creating a new website. It involves an activity that helps take your mind off of the
            stresses of life, just like a reset button. As we know, a reset button takes something back to its original state.
            Self-care helps to reset your mind so that you can become more focused and perform better on your outstanding tasks
            that requires a lot of brain power. The art of self-care is one you choose for yourself, as art is subjective.</p>
